                            Star Saber 1.0                          by  Nathan Sheldon=======================================================================            A patch for the Roland JV, XP, and XV Synths.=======================================================================Overview:This is a fun little patch that synthesizes the sound of a Lightsaberas heard in George Lucas's oroginal Star Wars motion picture.  Keys fromC -1 to G 3 all play the same sound...the sound made when the Lightsaberis turned on.  Keys G# 3 through G 5 all make the sound of the Lightsaberwhen it's moved quickly.  Finally, keys G# 5 through G 9 plays a soundsimilar to the sound made when Lightsabers hit eachother (lightly).Requirements:No expansion boards are required.  Only a Roland Super JV synthesizersuch as a JV-1080 or higher, an XP-30 or higher, or an XV-88 or higher.Control:Modulation:     Increases loudness of Lightsaber motion sound, and                  decreases the level of the Lightsaber striking sound.Sys-Ctrl-1:     Decreases the level of the Lightsaber humming (on) sound.Pitch Bend:     Bends sound up or down +/- 1 semitone.Notes And Commnets:Please feel free to comment on this patch.
