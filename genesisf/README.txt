What is The Ultimate Megadrive Soundfont?

The Ultimate Megadrive Soundfont is a soundfont by The Eighth Bit (AKA RecFreeMedia on youtube). The purpose of this soundfont is to emulate the YM2612 and PSG chip found in the Sega Genesis (aka Megadrive) without having to learn how to use TFM or the VOPM vst plugin. The project started out as Famicom Disk System-Megadrive Fusion, but as I was able to get more samples via KMOD Gens and TFM, a new soundfont was made using the drum samples from FDS-MD fusion, but this one dropped the FDS samples and focused on Genesis samples. Recently, the soundfont has gained popularity, after being released on Youtube and Sonic Retro.
