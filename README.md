# MIDI repository
These are JOELwindows7's private collection of MIDI file he has been collecting for his life.

For temporary this repo is private until certain moment where it safe to make public

We gotta do this because we are running out of *time*. We must make redundancy everywhere before it gone suddenly by the next tick.

Pardon, that we did not link the sauce, that's because it was very old, Joel didn't thought to save the sauce at that time. Only by recent where now he did.

If you saw this, and find that indeed the sauce is missing, feel free to submit an issue. both artist & collectors who had the sauce for each or serveral group of the MIDI files.
