Other Information: 
since you banned me, I couldn't ask the composer If I could upload this, so the jokes on you.the best Deku palace tune and you're obligated to erase it!*chuckles* now, if you'll unban me, I can get official permission. but if you don't I'm fine with it.

(Well, Yoshi gave us permission, so looks like we get to add it to the archive it anyway.  You, however, uploaded it without his permission, which is against the rules.  So in other words, you've just made us even more satisfied with our decision to ban you.  Sucks to be you, Shadow Archon.  -Pong64)
