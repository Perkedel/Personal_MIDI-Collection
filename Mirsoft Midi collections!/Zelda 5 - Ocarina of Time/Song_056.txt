Other Information: I've had this MIDI sitting around for over a few months now, but somehow I just never felt like uploading it... This is the first part to the ending of Zelda 64. I'm not equiped for the second part... I strongly, STRONLY reccommend you listen to it on a Yamaha Clavinova keyboard. I worked hard on this, even if it's only the first part...Okies, that's it for me! I hope it sounds alright... Comments & suggestions welcome: sirius64@yahoo.com
