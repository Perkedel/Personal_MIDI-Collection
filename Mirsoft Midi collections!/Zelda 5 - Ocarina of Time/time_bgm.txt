File Type: MIDI
Game System: Nintendo 64
Game Name: Zelda: Ocarina of Time
Song Title: Temple of Time
Sequenced by: Jimmy Vetayases <jimveta@hotmail.com>
Song Originally Composed by: Koji Kondo

Other Information: Ocarina version + Temple bgm- could use some attack time on the choirs to make it more faithful.. would mean seperating them into seperate channels since note decays overlap attacks in the original bgm.. oh well, call me lazy :p  -Jimmy
(Personally, that's what I wanted to do.  Attack time is important in this song.  Also, although the ocarina part is well-made, it--unfortunately--replaces the first main tune.  The main tune is supposed to be played twice, but it's a good MIDI, nonetheless.  -Peach)
