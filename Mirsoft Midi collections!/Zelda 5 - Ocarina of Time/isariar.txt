Uhh...yeah. I finally did a good one! Hehehe!
Do whatever with this, just don't say "I did it! Icy stole it!" I will probably not take legal action, but I most certainly will show Powerlord, Kalrac, and all the people on the forums this if you are caught! And you will be shamed...and called obscene names...and it will takr much time and effort for you to gain the trust of those who look down upon you!
Aww, man! I can't upload RIFF MIDIs? Oh well...*converts it* there...what's the diff?
