Dear friends:

      Here's my second Zelda 64 MIDI.  This time I had
help from Cakewalk Audio Pro 4, lent to me by KittyClaws
(thanks, Kitty) specifically for the fading of the notes
and copyright information.  I *strongly* recommend using
Awe 32/64 for this MIDI.  FM Synthesis will have certain
percussion instruments muted due to limited drums.  Sorry
that I couldn't compromise...  Please enjoy this piece of
work.  Cha-cha-cha!
  
                  Yours truly - -
                               Princess Toadstool (Peach)
