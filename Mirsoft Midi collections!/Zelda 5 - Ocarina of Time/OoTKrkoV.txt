Dear Zelda Fans:

     Here's yet another Zelda 64 MIDI from yours truly.  This one's from
Kakariko Village in the past when you are young Link.  Even the tempo changes
have been added to this song.  I really hope you guys like this one.  This
took a lot of hard work.  Enjoy!

                                    Yours truly - -
                                                   Princess Toadstool (Peach)
