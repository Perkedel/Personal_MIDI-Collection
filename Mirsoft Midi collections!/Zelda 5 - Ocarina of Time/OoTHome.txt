Game System: Nintendo 64
Game Name: Zelda: Ocarina of Time
Song Title: House
Sequenced by: Princess Peach Toadstool <toadstool@csnsys.com>
Other Information: Here's my very first Zelda 64 MIDI.  This song is played when you are in Link's House, or various other houses.  It's not very complex, but it's a cute little tune.  I strongly recommend playing this with a wavetable synth.
