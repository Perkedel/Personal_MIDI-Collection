Other Information: For the record, the original version of this songwas listed in the archive as a remix.  The songI sequenced never has been nor will be a remix.If you could correct the problem (that it reads:Lost World <# whatever>) I would be mostappreciative.  -Jeff
(FYI, I marked it as a remix because of the unusual instrument(s) I heard.  It sounded like a remix to me.  Perhaps it sounds different on your card.  Either way, I'll keep this as a regular version without a remix tag.  -Peach)
