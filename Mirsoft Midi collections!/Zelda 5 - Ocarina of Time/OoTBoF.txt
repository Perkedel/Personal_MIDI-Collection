Dear Zelda 64 Fans:

     Here's the ever-so-popular, song dedicated to the heart, "Bolero of Fire",
which you learn from Shiek at the entrance of the Fire Temple, in Death
Mountain Crater.  Although I'm not completely satisfied with this piece
(I am almost never, anyway), I'm sure the rest of you will enjoy this.  Short
song, but effective.  Feel free to tell me what you think.

                                    Yours truly - -
                                                   Princess Toadstool (Peach)
