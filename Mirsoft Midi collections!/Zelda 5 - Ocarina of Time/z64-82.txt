(We usually do not accept ZIP files for non-PC games, but after
investigating this, we have seen that this has a specific purpose and
would be more messy any other way.

This file contains the songs from the entire ending sequence (although
slight volume problems, especially at the end, but very good anyway),
and also four other MIDIs, breaking the major file into perfect pieces.
Those pieces are in great condition and do not seem to have the volume
problems which the largest file has.  -Peach)
