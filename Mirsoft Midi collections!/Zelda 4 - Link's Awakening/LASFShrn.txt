Dear Zelda Fans:

    Well, after playing a lot of Link's Awakening DX lately, I figured that I
should make a MIDI from the game.  Anyway, I like this little lament: the
background music in the southern Face Shrine where Link learns the sad truth...

                                    Yours truly - -
                                                   Princess Toadstool (Peach)
