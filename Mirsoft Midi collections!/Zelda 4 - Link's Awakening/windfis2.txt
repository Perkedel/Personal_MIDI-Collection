Game System: Gameboy
Game Name: Link's Awakening
Song Title: Ballad of the Windfish (2)
Other Information: This file was missing from the site.  As it was still in the zip, but not on the Gameboy page, I feel this is the easiest way to get it back into the collection so that people aren't subjected to the sonic horror that is currently masquerading as the Ballad of the Windfish.This isn't a remix, this isn't my song, I'm just the guy re-uploading it...
