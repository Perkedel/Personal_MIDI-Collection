Game System: Super Nintendo
Game Name: Zelda 3: A Link to the Past
Song Title: Kakariko Village (2)
Sequenced by: Princess Peach Toadstool <toadstool@csnsys.com>
Song Originally Composed by: Koji Kondo
Other Information: Believe it or not, this is the very first MIDI I've sequenced for a game (just recently added my 'copyrights').  There's another one on this site, but I consider that one more of a remix.  This one may not be 'better', but sounds closer to the actual game, at least coming from this sound card.
