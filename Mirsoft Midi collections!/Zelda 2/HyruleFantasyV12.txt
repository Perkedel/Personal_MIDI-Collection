Other Information: 
Just a bugfix, basically. The chords at the end didn't want to fully sound, so I changed the overall volume of the song, deleted some notation, etc. Also did some remixing to compensate for the changes.  -JILost
(Besides a good medley, this also appears to be a little bit of a jazz remix.  -Peach)
