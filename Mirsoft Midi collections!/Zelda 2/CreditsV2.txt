Other Information: 
I thought the original sequence I did was getting a bit outdated and I could do better now. But, since that one's gotten spread around a lot, rather than replacing it, I decided I'd just make one to go along with it. So, now there are 2 MIDIs of it, a good one and a bad one. Enjoy.
