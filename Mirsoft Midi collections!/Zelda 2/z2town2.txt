Other Information: I DID get his permission, so don't worry about that . . . I'm not sure weather you'd consider this a "remix" or not, because I did add little bits that go along with the song, and an extra harmony part (the NES only has 2, this file has 3), but I didn't add any new SECTIONS or change what was already there, just added on . . .
