Other Information: 
The original Arranger is un-contactable (It's the one in this same site above mine w/ the name "battle"). If anyone knows where they are, tell me and I'll promptly contact them and get their information. Also, this was made with a Turtle Beach "Santa Cruz" SC for use with a SUBWOOFER (It sounds alot better). I don't know how it'll sound on Sound Blasters.
