Dear Zelda Fans:

    I finally managed to sequence the entire song for the Color Dungeon in
Link's Awakening (DX version only!)!  For long-time Zelda fans, can you say
"nostalgia"?  Nos-tal-gi-a.  There.  I knew you could do it.  See if you can
recall this classic tune.  With shimmering harps and a rich contrabass, this
is a must for any nocturne lover.  Please enjoy!

                                    Yours truly - -
                                                   Princess Toadstool (Peach)
