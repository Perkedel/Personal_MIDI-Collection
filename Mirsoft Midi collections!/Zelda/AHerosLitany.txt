File Type: MIDI

Game Name: Legend of Zelda
Song Title: A Hero's Litany
Sequenced by: Jarel Jones <ArrowFox@mailandnews.com>
Song Originally Composed by: Koji Kondo (To a slight extent)/Jarel Jones

Other Information: This song really shouldn't be allowed up here as it's more of an original composition tha a remix, but it does contain pieces of the Zelda 1 (and 4) Overworld theme in it, so it sorta counts.  If the good people here at VGMusic decide it doesn't count and scrap it, you can always find it again at http://dszone.iwarp.com along with everything else I've made.  Thanks to Monique Morgan for the song title.  -Jarel
(I think this is a really beautiful piece.  A remix and medley of an original composition and overworld theme put together.  -Peach)
