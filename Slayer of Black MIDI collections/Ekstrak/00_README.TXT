NOTES ON GRABBAG - ORIGINAL VERSION

1. Please read the LICENSE file contained in this ZIP file.
You must accept the terms of this LICENSE in order to use the
MIDI files.  If you refuse to abide by the terms of the license,
DELETE THIS ARCHIVE AT ONCE.  Seriously.

2. There are two (2) different files included in the archive:

	GrabbagOriginalVer_GM1.mid
	GrabbagOriginalVer_GS1.mid

The first file is the one you want to play if you are using
Windows Media Player or some other simple MIDI player, especially
if you do not have a dedicated music card in your system.  It is a
simplified version of the song designed to play back on these systems,
so it may not sound exactly like the CD Audio version.

The second file contains GS commands specific to Roland devices.  It
is the more authentic of the two files, using patches that match the
CD Audio version.  It will sound most authentic if you use a Roland SC-88
Sound Canvas.  The only problem is that all of the tracks from this version
will not play on a system using Windows Media Player with the default
sound set.
