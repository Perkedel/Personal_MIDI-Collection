------------------------------------

I tried to remake the Alstroemeria Records song "Suwa Foughten Field" in MIDI form for the old Roland SC-88Pro. The song is a remix of Kanako Yasaka's theme (stage 6 boss of Touhou 10: Mountain of Faith). The original song was on the album "HARMONY", arranged by "Masayoshi Minoshima" with vocals by Nomico.

This pushes the MIDI bandwidth quite far in places, and as a result, the timing of the notes is slightly off in those places (mainly when many notes need to start at the same time).

The version in this download is 1.1, which fixes a stuttering kick drum around the 4-minute timestamp.
