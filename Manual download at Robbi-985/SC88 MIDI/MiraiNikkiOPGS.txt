Kuusou Mesorogiwi (Mirai Nikki OP)
	For the Roland SC-88Pro
	MIDI completed on 2012-10-02
------------------------------------

This is my finished MIDI for the Roland SC-88Pro. The song is 「空想メソロギヰ」 ("Kuusou Mesorogiwi"), used for the opening of the anime Mirai Nikki, originally by Yousei Teikoku.

I had great difficulty in making out the bass and the strings at times, so I may have (unintentionally) improvised at points, but I stayed as accurate as I possibly could.

This is my first time controlling the Sound Canvas's display via SysEx messages, and I ended up writing my own program to make messages to show the text. The MIDI also takes advantage of various other things the SC has to offer, such as a distortion insert effect with custom settings, cutoff frequency changes to make the down- and up-strokes of the guitar pick sound different, custom attack/decay/release times, and bank-changes for instruments such as palm-muted electric guitar, velocity-sensitive strings and explosion sound effect. Even though this sound module came out 15 years ago, it's still quite capable of sounding modern. =D
