This time, I tried to remake a trance song for the Roland Sound Canvas synth! I first heard this song many years ago on an internet radio site and became addicted to it, although I didn't know its name. I re-found it about 4 years later in a StepMania song pack.

This was surprisingly easy to make, despite having a few things that I've not used much before (delay echoes, changing of resonance over time, reversed kick). It took 6 days in total, but the majority of the work was done in the first 4 days.
